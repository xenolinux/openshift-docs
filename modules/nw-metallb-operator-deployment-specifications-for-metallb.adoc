= Deployment specifications for MetalLB

[role="_abstract"]
Deployment specifications in the `MetalLB` custom resource control how the MetalLB `controller` and `speaker` pods deploy and run in {product-title}.

Use deployment specifications to manage the following tasks:

* Manage scheduling by using pod priority and pod affinity.
* Assign CPU limits for MetalLB pods.
* Assign a container RuntimeClass for MetalLB pods.
* Assign metadata for MetalLB pods.
